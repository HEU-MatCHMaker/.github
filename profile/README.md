# HEU-MatCHMaker

A Horizon Europe project supporting excellence in research on methods and tools for developing new and sustainable advanced materials.

## Objectives
MatCHMaker works on the development of new and integrated characterisation methods and computational modelling for the design and validation of advanced materials. We want to better understand how materials behave at various scales: from tiny particles to the overall structure. The objectives are threefold:

### Accelerate advanced materials development

Develop a model-based innovation process to accelerate the materialsâ€™ design, validation, characterisation methods and computational modelling.

### Reinforce traceability, integrity and interoperability

Reinforce traceability, integrity and interoperability

### Develop an open data repository

An open data repository based on semantic representation aims to connect design and manufacturing processes.
